\chapter{The Graphics Library} \label{ch:graphics}
    The graphics library is a key component of the system, as it provides the
        functionality for creating images and animations using Haskell.
    The implementation of the graphics library was largely independent of the rest
        of the system, as it is responsible for generating the necessary data to render
        images and animations, rather than rendering them itself.

    \section{Library Overview}
        A graphics library does not need to be overly complex.
        A simple, well-documented API, with selection of graphical primitives and
            transformations, and a few helper modules, is all that is needed to allow users
            of all skill levels to use the library with ease.

        There were several sources of inspiration for the graphics library, including
            CodeWorld and P5.js.
        P5.js is a JavaScript library, and is therefore designed for imperative
            programming, with a large reliance on side effects and global state.
        Despite that, P5.js provides a straightforward API, with a nice selection of
            well-named functions, many of which can be adapted to fit the functional
            programming paradigm.
        CodeWorld, on the other hand, uses Haskell, so it is purely functional, with no
            side effects or global state, relying instead on function composition and
            recursion.
        While CodeWorld's API provides an excellent example of a functional graphics
            library, it is less straightforward than P5.js.
        The aim for our library is to find a balance between the simplicity of P5.js,
            and the functional design of CodeWorld.

        \subsection{Required Modules}
            The graphics library is split into a few modules, each with a specific purpose.
            Deciding which modules would be needed, proved to be relatively simple, as the
                library is not overly complex.
            The first and most obvious module required is the main module, which exports
                the public API for the library â€” the \verb|Lib| module.
            The second is the \verb|Internal| module, which simply contains the internal
                types and functions used by the library, which are not exposed to the user, but
                are used throughout the library.
            From there, we need to consider what a graphics library needs to be able to do.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The library needs to be able to represent the two-dimensional space
                      to draw on, i.e. the canvas.
                \item The library needs to be able to represent the graphical primitives
                      that can be drawn on the canvas.
                \item The library needs to be able to apply transformations to the graphical
                      primitives.
                \item The library needs to be able to render the canvas and the graphical
                      primitives to an image or animation.
            \end{itemize}
            Given these requirements, we can split the library into four modules:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \verb|Canvas|, to provide the functionality for creating and modifying
                      the canvas.
                \item \verb|Shape|, to provide the functionality for creating and modifying
                      graphical primitives.
                \item \verb|Maths|, to provide various mathematical functions and types, such
                      as vectors and angles.
                \item \verb|Color|, to provide several representations for colours.
            \end{itemize}
            The following sections will provide an overview of each of these modules,
                working from the bottom up, starting with the \verb|Color| module.
            This is because the \verb|Color| and \verb|Maths| modules are the simplest, and
                are used by the \verb|Shape| and \verb|Canvas| modules.

            For safety reasons, this library should not depend on anything other than
                Haskell's standard library, as it is designed to be used in a web browser,
                where the user should not be able to access the file system, or any other
                potentially harmful functionality.
            As such, modules like Haskell's \verb|System| module, are not available for use
                in this library, but anything defined in the \verb|Prelude| module is fine.

    \section{The Color Module}
        The \verb|Color| module is the simplest of the four modules, as it only needs
            to provide a way to represent colours.

        \subsection{Common Digital Colour Representations}
            There are several ways to represent colours in a graphics library, each with
                its own advantages and disadvantages.
            Some common representations are hexadecimal, RGB, HSL and HSV.

            \subsubsection{RGB and Hexadecimal}
                The hexadecimal and RGB (which stands for red, green, blue) representations are
                    two ways of representing the same thing, with the former being more concise,
                    and the latter being more readable.
                They both represent the colour as a combination of red, green and blue, with
                    each component being an integer between 0 and 255, so are naturally suited to
                    digital displays, which use red, green and blue light to create colours.
                Hexadecimal colours are represented as a string, starting with a hash symbol,
                    followed by three pairs of hexadecimal digits, representing the red, green and
                    blue components, respectively.
                If the red, green and blue components all consist of double digits, e.g.
                    \#FFEEDD, the colour be represented as three digits, e.g. \#FED, as a
                    shorthand.
                These representations can be visualised as a cube, with the x, y and z axes
                    representing the red, green and blue components, respectively, as shown in
                    Figure~\ref{fig:rgb}.

                \begin{figure}[H]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{rgb.png}
                        \caption{The RGB colour space.
                            Image taken from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV}{Wikipedia:
                                    HSL and HSV}.
                        }
                        \label{fig:rgb}
                \end{figure}

                Both RGB and hexadecimal colours can be extended to support an alpha channel,
                    allowing for transparency.
                For RGBA and hexadecimal colours, the alpha channel is represented as a
                    floating point number between 0.0 and 1.0, with 0.0 being fully transparent,
                    and 1.0 being fully opaque.
                The alpha channel in hexadecimal colours is represented as a pair of
                    hexadecimal digits, with 00 being fully transparent, and FF being fully opaque.
                Just as with the three-digit hexadecimal colours, if the alpha channel consists
                    of double digits, e.g. \#FFFFFFDD, the colour can be represented as four
                    digits, e.g. \#FFFD, as a shorthand.

            \subsubsection{HSL and HSV}
                HSL and HSV are very similar representations, with HSL representing the colour
                    as a hue, saturation and lightness, and HSV (also known as HSB) representing
                    the colour as a hue, saturation and value (or brightness).
                These representations are visualised as a cylinder, with the hue, saturation
                    and lightness/value components representing the angle, radius and height,
                    respectively, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:hsl}.

                \begin{figure}[H]
                    \centering
                    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{hsl.png}
                    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{hsv.png}
                        \caption{The HSL and HSV colour spaces.
                            Images taken from \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV}{Wikipedia:
                                    HSL and HSV}.
                        }
                        \label{fig:hsl}
                \end{figure}

                The hue component is an angle between 0 and 360 degrees, with 0 and 360
                    representing red, 120 representing green, 240 representing blue.
                The saturation component is a percentage between 0\% and 100\%, with 0\%
                    representing a shade of grey, and 100\% representing a fully saturated colour.
                The lightness/value component is also a percentage between 0\% and 100\%.
                For HSL, 0\% represents black, 100\% represents white, and 50\% represents the
                    colour itself.
                For HSV, 0\% represents black, 100\% represents the colour itself, and 50\%
                    represents white.

                As with RGB and hexadecimal colours, HSL and HSV can also be extended to
                    support an alpha channel, with the alpha channel being represented in the same
                    way as for RGBA colours.

        \subsection{The Color Type}
            For the purposes of this library, it made sense to consider what other
                libraries used for colour representation.
            CodeWorld offered both RGB and HSL, as well as a limited selection of named
                colours.
            Meanwhile, P5.js, as a JavaScript library, used any representation supported by
                CSS.
            Given that this library is designed to be used in a web browser, it made sense
                to follow P5.js's lead, and support all the colour representations that CSS
                supports: hexadecimal, RGB, RGBA, HSL and HSLA, as well as a selection of named
                colours~\citep{cssColours}.

            As such, the \verb|Color| type has 153 constructors.
            Named colours comprise 148 of these constructors, with the remaining five
                constructors representing the other colour representations supported by CSS.

            \begin{lstlisting}[language=haskell, label={lst:color}, caption={The Color type definition.
                Named colours have been omitted for brevity, but are included in the actual
                implementation, as seen in Appendix~\ref{app:code}.}]
data Color
    = RGB Int Int Int -- Red, Green, Blue (0-255)
    | RGBA Int Int Int Float -- Red, Green, Blue (0-255), Alpha (0.0-1.0)
    | Hex String -- 3, 4, 6 or 8 digit hexadecimal (0-f), with or without #, upper or lower case
    | HSL Int Int Int -- Hue (0-360), Saturation, Lightness (0-100)
    | HSLA Int Int Int Float -- Hue (0-360), Saturation, Lightness (0-100), Alpha (0.0-1.0)
    | ...
            \end{lstlisting}

    \section{The Maths Module}
        The \verb|Maths| module is the next simplest module, as the majority of the
            mathematical functions a user would need are provided by Haskell's standard
            library.
        However, there are a few types and functions that are not provided by the
            standard library, but are useful for a graphics library.

        \subsection{The Length Type}
            The first of these is the \verb|Length| type, which is used to represent
                lengths, such as the width and height of the canvas, the radius of a circle,
                the side length of a square.
            It is simple a type alias for \verb|Float|, so provides no additional type
                safety, but does provide a level of semantic clarity, particularly in the
                documentation.

        \subsection{The Vector Type}
            Vectors are a fundamental part of any graphics library, as they can be used to
                represent points, directions, velocities, forces, etc. As this library works
                with just two dimensions, our vectors only need to have two components, an x
                and a y.
            The \verb|Vector| type therefore has a single constructor, with two type
                parameters, both of type \verb|Float|.
            Note the use of the \verb|Float| type over the \verb|Length| type, once again
                for semantic clarity, as vectors are often used to represent several concepts,
                as mentioned above.
            An alternative to using a custom \verb|Vector| type would be to use a tuple of
                \verb|Float|s, but this would not provide the same level of type safety.
            For example, a function that takes a \verb|Vector| as an argument would not
                accept a tuple of \verb|Float|s, even though they are semantically the same.

            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:vector}, caption={The Vector type definition.}]
data Vector = Vector Float Float
            \end{lstlisting}

            \subsubsection{Vector Operations}
                Alongside the \verb|Vector| type, it is useful to provide a simple set of
                    functions for working with vectors.
                These functions include addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, scalar
                    division, dot product, cross product, magnitude, argument and normalisation.
                For the first four functions, make \verb|Vector| an instance of the \verb|Num|
                    type class, but this would require us to define all the functions in
                    \verb|Num|, which is unnecessary, as we only need a subset of them.
                Moreover, there is no defined division or multiplication for vectors, so it
                    would be misleading to make \verb|Vector| an instance of \verb|Num|.
                We can instead define the operators \verb|^+^|, \verb|^-^|, \verb|^*^| and
                    \verb|^/^|.
                These names reflect the standard \verb|+|, \verb|-|, \verb|*| and \verb|/|
                    operators, but with a caret (\verb|^|) to indicate that they are for vectors,
                    based on the standard mathematical notation for vectors, which uses a caret
                    above the vector symbol.

                \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:vectorOps}, morekeywords={Vector},
                caption={The vector operators.}]
(^+^) :: Vector -> Vector -> Vector
(^+^) (Vector x1 y1) (Vector x2 y2) = Vector (x1 + x2) (y1 + y2)

(^-^) :: Vector -> Vector -> Vector
(^-^) (Vector x1 y1) (Vector x2 y2) = Vector (x1 - x2) (y1 - y2)

(^*^) :: Vector -> Float -> Vector
(^*^) (Vector x y) s = Vector (x * s) (y * s)

(^/^) :: Vector -> Float -> Vector
(^/^) (Vector x y) s = Vector (x / s) (y / s)
            \end{lstlisting}

                The remaining functions are equally simple to define, and make use of several
                    functions from the \verb|Prelude| module.

                \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:vectorFns}, morekeywords={Vector},
                caption={The remaining vector functions.}]
mag :: Vector -> Float
mag (Vector x y) = sqrt (x ^ 2 + y ^ 2)

arg :: Vector -> Float
arg (Vector x y) = atan2 y x

norm :: Vector -> Vector
norm v = v ^/^ mag v

dot :: Vector -> Vector -> Float
dot (Vector x1 y1) (Vector x2 y2) = x1 * x2 + y1 * y2

cross :: Vector -> Vector -> Float
cross a b = mag a * mag b * sin (acos (dot a b))
            \end{lstlisting}

        \subsection{Angles}
            Angles are another fundamental part of any graphics library, as they are
                essential for rotations.
            There are several units for measuring angles, including degrees, radians,
                gradians and turns.
            The two most common units are degrees and radians, with degrees dividing a
                circle into 360 parts, and radians dividing a circle into $2\pi$ parts.
            Given that, it makes sense to provide users with the ability to work with both
                of these, and functions for converting between them.

            We can define two more type aliases for \verb|Float|, \verb|Degrees| and
                \verb|Radians|, to provide a level of semantic clarity, as with the
                \verb|Length| type.
            We can then define functions for converting between degrees and radians.

            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:angleFns}, morekeywords={Degrees, Radians},
                caption={The angle functions.}]  
radians :: Degrees -> Radians
radians degrees = degrees * pi / 180

degrees :: Radians -> Degrees
degrees radians = radians * 180 / pi
            \end{lstlisting}

        \subsection{Random Numbers}
            The final set of functions to provide in the \verb|Maths| module are those for
                generating random numbers.
            This can be very useful for creating more interesting animations, as it allows
                for a level of unpredictability.
            However, as this library is designed to not use Haskell's \verb|System| module,
                we cannot use the \verb|System.Random| functions for generating random numbers.
            Instead, we can create a simple pseudo-random number generator, using a linear
                congruential generator, which is a simple algorithm for generating
                pseudo-random numbers.
            This algorithm is defined by the recurrence relation $$X_{n+1} = (aX_n + c)
                    \text{ mod } m$$ where $X_0$ is the seed, $a$ is the multiplier, $c$ is the
                increment, and $m$ is the modulus.

            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:random}, caption={The random number
                generator, which uses a linear congruential generator to generate an infinite
                list of pseudo-random numbers, mapped to the range [0, 1].}]
randoms :: Int -> [Double]
randoms seed = map fst (iterate (lcg . snd) (lcg seed))
    where
        lcg :: Int -> (Double, Int)
        lcg seed = (fromIntegral newSeed / fromIntegral (2 ^ 32), newSeed)
            where
                newSeed = (1664525 * seed + 1013904223) `mod` 2 ^ 32
            \end{lstlisting}

            The values of $a$ (1664525), $c$ (1013904223) and $m$ ($2^32$) are taken from
                Equation~7.1.6, An Even Quicker Generator, in Chapter~7.1 of Numerical
                Recipes~\citep{numericalRecipes}.

            We can also provide a simple function to generate a seed, based on the current
                time, using the \verb|Data.Time.Clock.POSIX| module's \verb|getPOSIXTime|
                function.

            \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:seed}, caption={The seed function.}]
seed :: IO Int
seed = do
    time <- getPOSIXTime
    return (floor (time * 1000000))
            \end{lstlisting}

            The seed function returns an \verb|IO Int|, as it requires the current time to
                generate the seed, which is not known until runtime, so the function must be
                wrapped in the \verb|IO| monad.

    \section{The Shape Module}
        At the core of a graphics library are the graphical primitives, which are the
            basic building blocks for creating images and animations.
        Once again, it made sense to use a similar set of primitives to those found in
            P5.js and CodeWorld, as they are simple and easy to use, making them accessible
            for beginners.

        Ultimately, I settled on a \verb|Shape| type, with eight constructors:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item \verb|Empty|, which represents the empty shape, so has no type
                  parameters.
                  Drawing an empty shape has no effect.
            \item \verb|Group|, which represents a group of shapes, so has a single type
                  parameter â€” a list of shapes.
            \item \verb|Line|, which represents a straight line, so has just one type
                  parameter, of type \verb|Length|, representing the line's length.
            \item \verb|Ellipse|, which represents an ellipse, so has two type parameters,
                  both of type \verb|Length|, representing the ellipse's horizontal and vertical
                  radii.
            \item \verb|Rect|, which represents a rectangle, so has two type parameters, both
                  of type \verb|Length|, representing the rectangle's width and height.
            \item \verb|Polygon|, which represents any polygon, so has one type parameter, of
                  type \verb|[Vector]|, representing the polygon's vertices.
            \item \verb|Curve|, which represents both quadratic and cubic BÃ©zier curves, so has
                  one type parameter, of type \verb|[Vector]|, representing the curve's control
                  points.
            \item \verb|Arc|, which represents an arc, so has five type parameters.
                  Two of type \verb|Length|, representing the horizontal and vertical radii of
                      the arc, two of type \verb|Radians|, representing the start and end angles of
                      the arc, and one of type \verb|Connection|, representing how the arc closes
                      (either \verb|Open|, \verb|Chord| or \verb|Pie|).
        \end{itemize}

        All of these constructors, except for \verb|Empty| and \verb|Group|, take an
            extra type parameter of type \verb|ShapeOptions|.
        This stores the position (\verb|Vector|), angle (\verb|Radians|), fill colour
            (\verb|Color|), stroke colour (\verb|Color|) and stroke weight (\verb|Float|).

        While the \verb|Shape| type is exposed to the user, the constructors are not.
        Instead, the user interacts with the library through a set of functions, such
            as \verb|line|, \verb|ellipse| and \verb|rect|, which construct the shapes for
            the user.
        This allows the user to create shapes with default options, and then modify
            them as needed.

    \section{The Canvas Module}
        The canvas module is responsible for creating and modifying the canvas, which
            is the two-dimensional space on which the user can draw shapes.
        The canvas itself can be represented by a simple \verb|Canvas| type, with five type parameters:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Two \verb|Length|s to represent the width and height of the canvas.
            \item An \verb|Int| to represent the frame rate at which to render the animation.
            \item A \verb|Color| to represent the background colour to apply to each frame.
                  There is an argument for omitting this parameter, requiring users to instead
                      draw a rectangle filling the whole canvas, and applying the background colour
                      there.
                  However, as most animations are likely to use the same background colour for
                      each frame, this provides a more elegant, less repetitive solution.
            \item A \verb|[Shape]| to represent the frames of the animation.
        \end{enumerate}

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:canvas}, caption={The Canvas type definition.
            We use the field labels for internal use only. These are not exposed to the user, and are
            prefixed with \_ to indicate such, as well as to avoid polluting the namespace.}]
data Canvas = Canvas
    { _width :: Length
    , _height :: Length
    , _fps :: Int
    , _backgroundColor :: Color
    , _frames :: [Shape]
    }
        \end{lstlisting}

        Now that we have our \verb|Canvas| type, we need to provide an interface for
            users to interact with it.
        First, we need a function to create a new canvas.
        One option for this function is to take all the canvas parameters as arguments.
        However, this would require the user to write out each parameter in every
            program they write, even if these values are not important to them.
        To provide a more user-friendly interface, the function should provide default
            values for some parameters, requiring the user to only specify the width and
            height.

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:createCanvas}, caption={The createCanvas function.
            Default values are provided for the frame rate, background colour and frames.}]
createCanvas :: Length -> Length -> Canvas
createCanvas width height = Canvas width height 24 Transparent []
        \end{lstlisting}

        To modify the frame rate and background colour, the user can use the \verb|fps|
            and \verb|background| functions, respectively.

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:fps}, caption={The fps function.}]
fps :: Int -> Canvas -> Canvas
fps fps canvas = canvas{_fps = fps}
        \end{lstlisting}

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:background}, caption={The background function.}]
background :: Color -> Canvas -> Canvas
background color canvas = canvas{_backgroundColor = color}
        \end{lstlisting}

        The final interaction the user has with the canvas is to draw shapes on it.
        This is handled by two operators, \verb|(<<<)|, which adds a single
            \verb|Shape|, and \verb|(<<<:)|, which appends a list of \verb|Shape|s.

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:<<<}, caption={The operator to append a single
            frame to the canvas.}]
(<<<) :: Canvas -> Shape -> Canvas
(<<<) canvas shape = canvas{_frames = _frames canvas ++ [shape]}
        \end{lstlisting}

        \begin{lstlisting}[language=Haskell, label={lst:<<<:}, caption={The operator to append an
            entire list of frames to the canvas.}]
(<<<:) :: Canvas -> [Shape] -> Canvas
(<<<:) canvas shapes = canvas{_frames = _frames canvas ++ shapes}
        \end{lstlisting}

        With these functions, the user can create a canvas, set the frame rate and
            background colour, and draw shapes on it.
        The \verb|(<<<:)| operator was not strictly necessary, as users could instead
            use \verb|foldl (<<<) canvas shapes|, but it provides a more elegant solution.
        Using \verb|foldl| with \verb|(<<<)| would not allow the user to take advantage
            of Haskell's lazy evaluation, as the list of shapes would be fully evaluated
            due to the tail-recursive nature of \verb|foldl|.
